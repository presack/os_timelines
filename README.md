# os_timelines
Timelines of major Operating Systems

An interactive, visual history of the three major operating system families: **Windows**, **Linux**, and **macOS**. This project utilizes [TimelineJS3](https://timeline.knightlab.com/) to create a rich, media-heavy exploration of computing history. Details on usage of TimelineJS are available at the project's page.

You can view the main landing page and navigate to the individual timelines here:
